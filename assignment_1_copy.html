 <p><h4>
 when starting this project, i wanted to explore the memory of my grandparents moving away from their home in Sudbury two summers ago. this experience was emotional on many levels, as it is where I spent/had my fondest memories throughout my adult and childhood. when trying to create a composition that symbolized my experience in sudbury, i immediately thought of a crossword puzzle- something all of us participated in when we would visit. i used a crossword maker template while thinking of words that i associated the city/ my family with. i started mapping out my puzzle in google excel where i added more “answers” along the way. once the crossword was complete, i thought it lacked the personal approach i intended on showcasing, so i started formulating bits of written poetry to act as clues that i placed around the border of the puzzle. Overall, I am happy with the finished outcome of my poster. i believe it showcases the personal side of my memory in saying goodbye to the city and my grandparent’s house.

during my process, i started taking screenshots of the city on google maps while compiling imagery of songs and text into a word document. i felt that the composition lacked the personal touch i wanted to convey, so i dove deeper into what memories were most meaningful when visiting my grandparents- eventually leading me in creating a crossword puzzle. i started creating illustrations within sublime text where i drew my grandparent’s house and a crossword puzzle. i liked the idea of incorporating text into my poster along with the crossword but was not sure if i wanted to include clues or answers. once i completed my crossword, i decided it needed something more to convey meaning regarding my experience, so I started incorporating bits of written elements within the puzzle, which led to mimicking a version of a journal entry. overall, the process of creating this poster has been beneficial in showcasing my experience in saying goodbye to my second home.
