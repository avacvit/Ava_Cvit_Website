<h5><p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);"> process</p></h5>

<p><h4>
during my process, i started experimenting with various shapes within the elements of colour, placement and scale. as this was my first time working with html & css coding, many of my completed sketches are not as comprehensive and developed as i wished, but i am still happy with the selected designs submitted.
